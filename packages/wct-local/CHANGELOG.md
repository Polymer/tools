## [v2.0.16] - 2017-11-16
- Update to cleankill@^2.0.0. This fixes an issue in WCT v6.4.0 where the tests would finish and the browsers would close, but the WCT process would not end. This was because the versions of cleankill diverged and so they used different event queues for handling cleanup.

## [v2.0.15] - 2017-05-09

- Update launchpad@v0.6.0

  /**
   * Creates a debouncer if no debouncer is passed as a parameter
   * or it cancels an active debouncer otherwise. The following
   * example shows how a debouncer can be called multiple times within a
   * microtask and "debounced" such that the provided callback function is
   * called once. Add this method to a custom element:
   *
   * ```js
   * import {microTask} from '@polymer/polymer/lib/utils/async.js';
   * import {Debouncer} from '@polymer/polymer/lib/utils/debounce.js';
   * // ...
   *
   * _debounceWork() {
   *   this._debounceJob = Debouncer.debounce(this._debounceJob,
   *       microTask, () => this._doWork());
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * If the `_debounceWork` method is called multiple times within the same
   * microtask, the `_doWork` function will be called only once at the next
   * microtask checkpoint.
   *
   * Note: In testing it is often convenient to avoid asynchrony. To accomplish
   * this with a debouncer, you can use `enqueueDebouncer` and
   * `flush`. For example, extend the above example by adding
   * `enqueueDebouncer(this._debounceJob)` at the end of the
   * `_debounceWork` method. Then in a test, call `flush` to ensure
   * the debouncer has completed.
   *
   * @param debouncer Debouncer object.
   * @param asyncModule Object with Async interface
   * @param callback Callback to run.
   * @returns Returns a debouncer object.

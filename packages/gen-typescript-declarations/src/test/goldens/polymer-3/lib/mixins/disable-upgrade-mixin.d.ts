/**
 * Element class mixin that allows the element to boot up in a non-enabled
 * state when the `disable-upgrade` attribute is present. This mixin is
 * designed to be used with element classes like PolymerElement that perform
 * initial startup work when they are first connected. When the
 * `disable-upgrade` attribute is removed, if the element is connected, it
 * boots up and "enables" as it otherwise would; if it is not connected, the
 * element boots up when it is next connected.
 *
 * Using `disable-upgrade` with PolymerElement prevents any data propagation
 * to the element, any element DOM from stamping, or any work done in
 * connected/disconnctedCallback from occuring, but it does not prevent work
 * done in the element constructor.
 *
 * Note, this mixin must be applied on top of any element class that
 * itself implements a `connectedCallback` so that it can control the work
 * done in `connectedCallback`. For example,
 *
 *     MyClass = DisableUpgradeMixin(class extends BaseClass {...});

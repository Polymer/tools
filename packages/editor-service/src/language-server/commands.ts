 * part of a few LSP features, including Code Actions.
 *
 * In the initial version of the spec they were something that the server asked
 * the client to do, but that's unsatisfying because it requires special code
 * for every client. So as of v3 of the protocol, the server can declare
 * commands that it can handle.
 *
 * This class is responsible for executing those commands.

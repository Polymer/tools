/**
 * Once this file is imported, all subsequent plylog based logging will take

 *
 * As it is common for modules to instantiate their loggers upon import,
 * this log interception must take place as a side effect of importing this
 * module, and this module should be imported before any others.
 *
 * Forwarding logging like this helps us both by making the logs available and
 * by ensuring that we don't disrupt the stdio-based communication channel
 * between the LSP server and the editor.

 * See https://github.com/Polymer/vscode-plugin/issues/48 for more info on

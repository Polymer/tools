# Changelog


<!-- ## Unreleased -->
<!-- Add new, unreleased items here. -->

## v1.7.3 [06-11-2018]
* Regenerate shrinkwrap to pick up latest dependencies.

## v1.7.2 [05-11-2018]
* Fix bug in `polymer-3-element` init template where `polymer/dom-module.js`
  could be loaded twice when serving from the polyserve `/components/`
  directory.
* Fix names of `uncompiled-bundled` and `uncompiled-unbundled` build presets.

## v1.7.1 [05-09-2018]
* Workaround an NPM shrinkwrap bug which was causing users to install the CLI's
  250MB of devDependencies unnecessarily.
* Fixed polymer 3.x application and element templates to use the `html` tagged
  template literal function.

## v1.7.0 [05-08-2018]
* Fix bug with `init` templates and missing `.gitignore` files due to npm
  renaming them to `.npmignore` on install of cli.
* Fix `test` bug which broke Windows support relating to path delimeters.
* Change the default value of --module-resolution to "node".
* Polymer `lint` and `analyze`, when run without files, will look for sources
  from your `polymer.json` file. If none are given, it will scan all matching
  files as before.
  - Specifically it considers any files listed in `sources`, `fragments`,
    `shell`, and `entrypoint` as the source files for your project, and will
    ignore all others.
* Updated dependencies.

## v1.7.0-pre.17 [05-03-2018]
* The transform for `import.meta` now uses the special `"meta"` dependency
  provided by
  [@polymer/esm-amd-loader](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/esm-amd-loader),
  instead of injecting a static path. As a result, it is now always coupled with
  the AMD transform, and cannot be enabled independently.
* The [regenerator runtime](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator) is now
  injected into projects that are compiling to ES5. This is needed to support
  async/await and generators. `serve` will include the runtime in each script
  where it is used while `build` will include it once, inline, in the entrypoint
  HTML file.
* Added es5, es2015, es2016, es2017, and es2018 compile targets to the
  `js.compile` option of `polymer.json`, to allow fine grained control over
  which JavaScript features to compile during `build`.

## v1.7.0-pre.16 [05-01-2018]
* Dropped support for node v6. This is a soft break, as we aren't
  making any changes that are known to break node v6, but we're no longer testing against it. See our [node version support policy](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/node-support)
  for details.
* `build`:
  * Disable the `simplify` babel plugin when minifying javascript. See
    https://github.com/babel/minify/issues/824
  * Disable the `mangle` babel plugin as well. See
    https://github.com/Polymer/tools/issues/261
* `serve`:
  * Fixed issue where resources would be cached after restarting with
    different compilation/transformation options. We've turned off most
    browser-side caching. As a reminder: do not use `polymser serve` as a
    production webserver, it is designed for development.
* `serve`, `build`:
  * Replaced RequireJS AMD loader with
    [@polymer/esm-amd-loader](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/esm-amd-loader),
    which is smaller and better emulates the behavior of ES modules.
  * Add "webcomponents-bundle.js" to the heuristic used to determine when to
    inject the Custom Elements ES5 Adapter.

## v1.7.0-pre.15 [04-25-2018]
* `@babel/preset-es2015` has been replaced with a manually-created version so that `@babel/plugin-transform-classes` can be pinned to v7.0.0-beta.35 to avoid a bug where the polyfilled HTMLElement constructor is not called. (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7506)
* Rewritten dynamic `import()` calls now test if a bundle has exports before attempting to destructure bundle.

## v1.7.0-pre.14 [04-23-2018]
* `init`:
  * Fixed a bug which caused `.gitignore` to be excluded from published templates.
* `build`:
  * Disable Babel `minify-constant-folding` plugin when minifying. This plugin has a bug that breaks when a constant is exported from a module (https://github.com/babel/minify/issues/820).
  * Added `--auto-base-path` flag. Sets the entrypoint `<base>` tag for all builds to match the name of that build. Unlike other flags, does not necessarily trigger a single one-off build.
* `serve`, `test`:
  * Stricter requirements for determining when a browser supports modules, and
    hence when to automatically transform modules to AMD. We now require support
    for dynamic import and import.meta.

<!-- Add new, unreleased items here. -->

## v1.7.0-pre.13 [04-19-2018]
* `init`
  * Added the `polymer-3-starter-kit` template; a (prerelease) version of
    Polymer Starter Kit, ported to Polymer 3.

## v1.7.0-pre.12 [04-18-2018]
* `serve`
  * Fix node module resolution for the case where the root package is served
    from the components/ directory and imports a module from its own package
    using a path.

## v1.7.0-pre.11 [04-17-2018]
* `build`
  * The Babel helpers script now includes all Babel helpers that could be used by the ES5 compilation and AMD transforms.
  * Inline JavaScript will now only be transformed to AMD modules if they have type=module.
  * External JavaScript files will now only be transformed to AMD modules if they contain module import/export syntax.

## v1.7.0-pre.10 [04-12-2018]
* Pick up latest fixes to web-component-tester.

## v1.7.0-pre.9 [04-11-2018]
* Fix AMD transform bug where if an HTML document had multiple type=module scripts, and any of them (apart from the first) had any kind of import, then that import was not accessible (because it was mapped to the wrong module callback function argument).
* Update to latest web-component-tester.

## v1.7.0-pre.8 [04-11-2018]
* Fix broken release.

## v1.7.0-pre.7 [04-10-2018]
* Update polyserve for latest changes.

## v1.7.0-pre.6 [04-09-2018]

- Automatically generate a `.gitignore` file when execute init command and select `element` or `application`.
- Added ability to use globs on `analyze` and `lint` commands
- JS compile build transformer will now rewrite bare module specifiers to paths.
- Add `--module-resolution` flag which can be `none` (the default) or `node`.

## v1.6.0 [02-02-2018]
- Added support for `exclude` option in `polymer.json` for the build command's `minify` and `compile` options for `css`, `js` and `html` files.
- Added `--fix` option to `polymer lint`. When passed, some warnings with simple mechanical solutions will be fixed.
  - Also supports warnings which can be addressed with less-safe changes via
    an interactive prompt and the `--edits` flag. See `polymer lint --help` for
    more info.
- Added `--watch` (shorthand `-w`) option to `polymer lint`. When passed, we will watch the filesystem for changes and rerun the linter immediately afterwards.
  - Also works with `--fix` to automatically fix and report warnings as you work!
- `build` Added a CLI argument for setting the `basePath` option: `--base-path`.
- Derives node version check from the package.json.
- The polymer.json project config can now specify paths to exclude when minifying files and compiling JavaScript.  See https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-project-config/issues/50 for more.

## v1.3.0 [06-30-2017]
- Added support for optional polymer-project-config provision of bundler options instead of only boolean value for the `bundle` property of build definitions.  See the [Polymer Project Config 3.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-project-config/pull/37) for details on new options available in polymer.json.
- Includes Polymer Build fixes to push-manifest generation and others.  See [Polymer Build 1.6.0 release notes](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build/pull/249).
- Includes Polymer Bundler fixes to shell strategy and others.  See [Polymer Bundler 2.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/pull/573).

- `build` Support for new `basePath` build config option that remaps paths to assist in serving at non-root paths, such as when doing differential serving of multiple builds from the same host. Affects service worker generation, push manifest generation, and also updates the entrypoint's `<base>` tag if found.
- `build` Building your project will now write a copy of your `polymer.json` to the build directory. This provides a log of the build options used at the time, including expansion of presets.

## v0.18.4 [05-15-2017]
- Updated dependencies to support official `polymer-analyzer` 2.0.0 and `web-components-tester` 6.0.0 releases.

## v0.18.3 [05-12-2017]
- Fix the CLI preset flag.
- Fix an issue where compiling JS would crash in versions of node with native async iterators.
- `bundle` no longer emits any JS or CSS files which have been inlined into bundles.

## v0.18.2 [05-10-2017]

## v0.18.1 [04-25-2017]

- `init` small template fixes.
- `serve` now respects the `entrypoint` configured in `polymer.json`.
- Remove ability to run a locally installed version of the CLI if it exists in the current working directory. This unexpected behavior was never documented but some users could be running an incorrect version of the CLI as a result.
- Update Node.js version pre-run check to match latest supported versions.

## v0.18.0 [04-13-2017]

v0.18.0 contains our latest work to support both Polymer 1.x & 2.0 projects. There are a bunch of big new features included in this update, as well as several breaking changes since the latest version. Here is a quick summary of the major changes for anyone who is updating from our previous `latest`/`v0.17.0` version:

- **New Polymer 2.0 Templates**: `polymer init` has added new Polymer 2.0 templates for starter elements, applications, and our latest Polymer Starter Kit & Shop applications. Run `polymer init` to see the whole list.
- **Updated `lint` Command**: `polymer lint` is now powered by our newest version of [polymer-linter](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-linter). The new linter can show you the exact location of any problems in your code, and is much more configurable. Run `polymer help lint` for more information.
- **Updated `build` Command**: `polymer build` is now powered by our newest version of [polymer-build](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-linter), which provides even more optimizations and features for customizing your build. Run `polymer help build` for more information.
- **New Build Output**: The biggest change to `polymer build` behavior is that it no longer defaults to outputting two, optimized build targets. The new default behavior is to generate a single `/build/default` directory with all configurable optimizations turned off by default. To customize your build(s) and include different optimizations, you can either include CLI flags (like `--js-compile`) or custom polymer.json build configurations. See the latest [polymer.json "builds"](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json#builds) specification for more information.
- **New `analyze` Command:** Generates a JSON blob of metadata about your element(s). This can be useful to have for tooling and analysis.
- **New `install` Command:** Like `bower install`, but with support for installing "variants" as defined in your `bower.json`. See [the glossary](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/glossary#dependency-variants) for more information.
- Remove Node v4 support: Node v4 is no longer in Active LTS, so as per the [Polymer Tools Node.js Support Policy](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/node-support) the Polymer CLI will not support Node v4 going forward. Please update to Node v6 or later to continue using the latest verisons of Polymer tooling.

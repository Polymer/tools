/**
 * `iron-icons` is a utility import that includes the definition for the `iron-icon` element, `iron-iconset-svg` element, as well as an import for the default icon set.
 *
 * The `iron-icons` directory also includes imports for additional icon sets that can be loaded into your project.
 *
 * Example loading icon set:
 *
 *     <link rel="import" href="../iron-icons/maps-icons.html">
 *
 * To use an icon from one of these sets, first prefix your `iron-icon` with the icon set name, followed by a colon, ":", and then the icon id.
 *
 * Example using the directions-bus icon from the maps icon set:
 *
 *     <iron-icon icon="maps:directions-bus"></iron-icon>
 *
 *     To load a subset of icons from one of the default `iron-icons` sets, you can
 *     use the [poly-icon](https://poly-icon.appspot.com/) tool. It allows you
 *     to select individual icons, and creates an iconset from them that you can
 *     use directly in your elements.
 *
 * See [iron-icon](#iron-icon) for more information about working with icons.
 *
 * See [iron-iconset](#iron-iconset) and [iron-iconset-svg](#iron-iconset-svg) for more information about how to create a custom iconset.
